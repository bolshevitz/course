    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler takes a program written in pseudo-english (\"source code\") and converts it into \"object code\" which is typically stored in a file. For example when you have a c file, \"hello.c,\" and you \"compile\" it by running `gcc -Wall -c hello.c` on a terminal, there will be a file created called `hello.o`, which is object code, which you could then run\n",

    "\"Machine\" code is binary code (01001000) that can be directly executed by a CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Object\" code is a portion of machine code for one particular library (or part) of the completed program. Remember, it could take multiple files to make a completed program. Object code may contain placeholders or offsets that a \"linker\" will then use to connect everything together.\n",

    "### Interpreter\n",
    "There are multiple types of interpreters, but Python translates the source code into an intermediate representation and **executes instructions one statement at a time**\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter does not need a compile step to run code. \n",
    "\n",
    "    C program (uses a compiler)\n",
    "        1. run a command to save the code\n",
    "        2. run a command to compile it\n",

    "    Python (uses an interpreter) \n",
    "        1. run a command to save the code \n",
    "        2. run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "A compiler translates all the source code into machine level once and creates machine code that can directly be run. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter has to do some of this translation everytime a statement or function is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speed\n",
    "Since a compiler has to look at the source code as a whole, it takes a long time to analyze and translate it into machine code and link it with other binaries, before it can be executed. The larger the code, the longer you wait! Executing the machine code is much faster though. Remember it is All Source Code -> Object code -> Machine Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an interpreter only has to look at the source code statement by statement, it takes a shorter time to analyze and translate, but execution will be much slower because a compiler is designed to optimize code and gives itself ample time to do it. Typically it is Partial Source Code -> Machine Code, Partial Source Code -> Machine Code, and etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "Think about it this way, say that you had an army of 100,000. If you had 100,000 people given to you at once, it will take much longer to organize everybody, but you can plan the best and most efficient means of deploying them. However, if you didn't know how many people you have, and you only get 1000 people here, 5000 people there, it will take  shorter to deploy them and get them into action, but it will take longer to deploy everybody, because you didn't know how many people you were working with and would have to repeat a lot of the same processes"
